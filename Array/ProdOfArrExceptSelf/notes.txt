Product of array except self

Given an integer array, return the
product of all integers except integer[i].
The timecomplexity must be 0(n), and no
division allowed.

Example:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Soltion and takeaways:
Medium:
 No bruteforce beacuse of the time complexity limit.
 To solve the problem we use a array to store result
 values. We iterate through the input array 2 times.
 The first time we calculate the product of all numbers
 before numbers[i]. We then take the product and store
 it in result[i]. We call this the postproduct.
 Then we iterate over the array again backwards.
 This time we calculate the product of all numbers
 post numbers[i], but rather then storing it at 
 correspondning result[i], when multiply it with 
 result[i] then store it. Doing it this way gets
 us the right product from all numbers excpet numbers[i].
