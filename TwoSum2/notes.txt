TwoSum 2

Given a asc sorted 1-dimensional array and a target
integer, return indicies of two numbers which
sum == target.

Example:
Input: numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]

Solution and takeaways:
Easy:
 Bruteforce.
 Iterate over each character and add with
 rest of the array until target is reached.

Hard:
 Two pointer algorithm.
 Use 2 pointers when iterating over the array.
 1 at the beginnig and 1 at the end. At each iteration
 compare the sum of the pointers until target is
 reached. Beacuse the array is sorted, its important
 to inc/dec the right pointer if sum != target.
 If sum of pointers is > target, we decrement right
 pointer beacuse of the ascending order of numbers,
 otherwise the increment the left pointer.§§_wq
