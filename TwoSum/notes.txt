TwoSum

Given an array of integers and an integer target, return 
indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Example:
Input: numbers = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Solution and takeaways:
Easy:
 Bruteforce.
 Iterate through the array in separate loops.
 Inner loop is based on outer loop index + 1 and outer loop
 is limited to search through numbers - 1. Inside of inner loop,
 add numbers[outerIndex] with numbers[innerIndex] and check if 
 sum == target. If so, return outerIndex and innerIndex, otherwise
 continue bruteforce until sum == target.

Hard:
 Usage of a dictionary.
 Iterate through the input numbers.
 Use the target number and subtract each input number
 as we iterate over the array. Check if the result of the
 subtraction exists in the dictionary, if not, add the input
 number to the dictionary with corresponding index as value and 
 input as key. Iterate until you get a difference from the
 subtraction that matches a key in the dictionary.
 (When working with c#, duplicates is not allowed in
  the dictionary structure. To overcome input data that
  has duplicates, we only use 1 entry in the dictionary,
  and instead of adding when the difference from the subtraction
  is nonexisting, we overwrite the single value stored in the 
  dictionary until we get a match 
  (dict[key] = index instead of dict.Add(key, index))
