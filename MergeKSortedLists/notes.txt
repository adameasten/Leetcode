Merge K sorted lists

Given a array if linkedlists,
where the lists are sorted in asc
order, merge all linkedlists into 
one sorted linked list.

Example:
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]

Solution and takeaways:
Hard:
 Implement a mergesort algoritm
 to split the input list into two
 sorted lists at a time and merge
 those. Keep merge lists in pair of
 2 and sort until you've traversed
 the tree structure and have 1 
 sorted list left.
 Make use of the MergeTwoSortedLists
 leetcode problem solution to merge
 each pair from the list.
