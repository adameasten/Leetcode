Longest Palindromic substring

Given a string, return the longest
palindromic substring.

Example:
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"

Solution and takeaways:
Easy:
 Bruteforce.
 Use 2 loops to iterate over the input
 string and find all substrings. Check 
 if any strings are palindromic by a 
 equality check against itself reversed.
 Keep track of the longest palindromic
 substring when comparing.

Hard:
 Loop over each character in the input data.
 Use each char as a middlepoint and expand 
 with a left and right index to check for equal
 characters. This way we can find the longest
 palindromic substring in 0(n2) time.
 To take care of even numbered palindromic
 substrings, we use a offset on the right 
 index when we expand.
