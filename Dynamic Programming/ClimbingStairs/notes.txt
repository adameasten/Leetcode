Climbing stairs

You are climbing a staircase. The input is the
amount of steps the stairs have. You can only 
take one or two steps at a time. How many 
distinct ways can you reach the top?

Example:
Input: 3
Output: 3 (1+1+1, 1+2, 2+1)

Solution:
Medium
 A little bit tricky. To solve this 
 problem we use dynamic programming.
 To start we recurse starting from 0,
 creating a tree structure and compute
 all possible ways with DFS. But doing it
 this way, when we visualize the tree,
 we can see that we are calculating
 the same problem in several subtrees.
 To take care of that problem we could 
 use Memoization to get subtree values
 from the cache instead of calculating
 them multiple times.
 Another valid solution which we choose,
 is to start from the top of the stair
 and go down. This way we can calculate
 on each step how many it took to get there
 and add it togheter with previous step.
