Combination Sum

Given an array of distinct integers and a target,
return a list of all possible unique combinations
where the chosen numbers sum up to target.

Example:
Input: nums = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3], [7]]

Solution and takeaways:
Hard:
 Implement a backtracking algorithm
 which uses recursion and a depth
 first search approach to find all 
 unique combinations. We do it this way
 to avoid any duplicates when building
 the tree structure and searching for any
 matching combination which == target.
 Start from the left number and find all
 possible solutions from that number until
 youve exceeded the target value. Then go back
 one step at a time in the tree and traverse 
 down to the left to check rest of the input
 num array togheter with the parent combination
 of your deepest leaf node on the left side.
