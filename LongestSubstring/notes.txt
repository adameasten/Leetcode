Longest Substring without repeating characters

Given a string, find the length if the longest 
substring without repeating characters.

Example:
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3

Solution and takeaways:
Easy:
 Bruteforce.
 Use 2 loops to iterate over the input string.
 1 outer loop to keep track of each character
 in the string, and a inner loop to iterate through
 the string to find all substrings without repeating
 characters. Keep track of which of the length of 
 the substrings you find and return the longest.

Hard:
 Sliding window.
 Use a sliding window algorithm to determine the
 longest substring. When iterating over the characters
 keep track of the substring with a hashset, and 2 separate
 indices to track the sliding window. Iterate over the 
 inputdata with first index and add characters to the set 
 until a repeated character appears. Use the second index 
 to shrink the sliding window and remove all characters from
 the input data so that the window doesn't contain any duplicates.
 Keep track of the set size to determine when the longest substring
 is found.
