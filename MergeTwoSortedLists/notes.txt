Merge two sorted linkedlists

Given the head of two sorted 
linked lists, merge the two lists 
together to one sorted list.

Example:
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Solution and takeaways:
Medium:
 Start with a dummy node and a tail var
 to keep track of the tail when traversing
 the linked list. Traverse the list and 
 compare the two input lists values,
 one at a time. Assign the lowest value to the
 tail and move it forward on pair with the 
 traversal of the linked lists. This way
 we get an update by reference to the dummy nodes
 subsequent links in the list. When we reach the end
 of both lists, all values should be added in order
 beneath the dummy head. Return dummy.next to get
 the full list.
