ValidParentheses

Given a string containing just the 
characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', 
determine if the input string is valid.
The string is valid if all brackets are 
closed in the right order.

Example:
Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true

Solution and takeaways
Medium:
 Solve the problem by using a stack.
 Iterate over each char in the input array.
 When encountering any openening bracket,
 push the corresponding closing bracket onto
 the stack. When encountering a closing bracket,
 pop the stack and compare the top value with 
 your closing bracket. Since we have pushed 
 closed brackets for each open bracket from the
 start, we should have atleast 1 closing bracket
 matching each pop. If not, the solution is 
 incomplete and we can return.
