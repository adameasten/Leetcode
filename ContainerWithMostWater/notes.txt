Container with most water

You are given an array of integers 
representing heights of bars. If drawn
in a graph whre X-axis is index and 
Y-axis is the value of the integers,
find the biggest container (area) which
wont spill any water if filled.

Example:
Input: [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]
Output: 49

Solution and takeaways:
Easy:
 As always, bruteforce.
 Iterate over each integer input and 
 compare with all the other integers.
 Multiply the lowest integer with the 
 index difference to get a area of a 
 container which wont spill any water.
 Keep track of largest area.

Hard:
 Two pointers.
 Initialize two pointers two iterate over
 the array from both ends. While the left
 pointer is larger than the right pointer,
 calculate the area between the smallest
 integer the index of the bigger. Walk from
 each end of the integer array until 
 right pointer is at a index <= left pointer index.
